### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Stefane Fermigier, I trained and worked as a mathematician in the 80s and 90s, discovered free and open source software in the 90s (my first contact with Linux was with version 0.10 in December 1991), and switched my career to open source software enterpreneurship in the 00s.

More personal information, and my full CV, can be found on my website: <https://fermigier.com/>.

I discovered Python around 1992, while working on my PhD (a part of my thesis was implemented using the PARI/GP computational arithmetic project, for which I made a Python binding ; I also made Python bindings to the PVM parallel computation framework).

Here are some automated stats about my current public projects
